poloka-@MODULE@
===========

poloka is a software package to process astronomical
images. poloka-@MODULE@ is the @MODULE@fielding module
of the poloka suite. It contains:

* bias subtraction, @MODULE@ and super@MODULE@ building
* fringe map building (with PCA) and automatic fringe subtraction

It is a bit old and stale package since most observatories provide
calibration files nowadays. It also needs a full rewrite as most
poloka modules.

To install poloka-sub, see the INSTALL file.
